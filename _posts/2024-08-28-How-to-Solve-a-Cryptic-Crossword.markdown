## What's in a clue?

A cryptic crossword clue typically contains:

- a definition of the answer word;
- a subsidiary indicator that clues the same answer word, usually involving wordplay; and
- nothing else.

There may or may not be a word or phrase (e.g. "or", "is", "and", "to be", etc.) indicating where the split is between definition and wordplay.

The definition, which always appears either at the start or at the end of the clue, must be one acceptable as a standalone clue in a standard crossword. This means that it has to agree in tense, conjugation, pluralization, and other aspects with the answer word.


## Types of cryptic clues

In the example clues below, the definition part(s) will be underlined.


### Double definition and cryptic definition

In a double definition clue, the wordplay is simply another definition of the answer word. For instance, the clues

> - <u>European</u> <u>shine</u> (6)
> - <u>Pay attention to</u> <u>shortly written message</u> (4)
> - <u>Get on</u> <u>supervisory committee</u> (5)

would give the answers POLISH, NOTE and BOARD.

Generally, the two definitions must be unrelated, or at least disconnected enough so that the answer is unambiguous.

Another type of clue that consists only of definitions is the cryptic definition clue. These clues contain only one, albeit significantly trickier-to-parse, definition. For example,

> - This cylinder is jammed (5, 4)
> - Sporting event one’s bound to compete in (5-6, 4)
> - They lead the way in the present transport system (8)

clue SWISS ROLL, THREE-LEGGED RACE and REINDEER.


### Charades

Charades clues hint at parts of the word independently. For example:

> - Journey for particles leads to issues (9)
> - Month with the Spanish work of fiction (5)

have the answers QUESTIONS (QUEST + IONS) and NOVEL (NOV + EL, "the" in Spanish).


### Reversals

Reversal clues, where a string of letters is reversed, are indicated with a word that suggests inversion. This includes "back", "overturned", "sent back", "revolutionary" and "flipped". For instance,

> - Circle back to reservoir (4)
> - Rescue lambasted revolutionary (7)

have the answers LOOP (POOL backwards) and DELIVER (REVILED backwards).
Depending on whether the clue points down or across, different directional words can also be used as reversal indicators. For example, the across clue

> - Jeans material dug up from the east (5)

clues DENIM because "from the east" (i.e. from right to left) it reads MINED, which means "dug up". Similarly,
the down clues

> - Turned up anxious to get sweet foods (8)
> - In uprising, be malevolent (4)

give DESSERTS and EVIL respectively because reading upwards, the letters spell STRESSED (a synonym of "anxious") and LIVE (a synonym of "be").
Note that different clue types can be combined, so a clue may involve, say, both charades and reversals. For example,

> - Cleans up backward servant with some poultry (8)

clues FRESHENS (SERF backwards + HENS).



### Extractions

In extractions, pieces are taken from the clue itself. There are a few different types, as listed below.

1. Hidden word: The answer word is hidden inside a phrase.
      - Micropalaeontologist’s hiding a gemstone (4) → OPAL
      - Burning bush - other kept secret (3) → HOT

1. Acrostic: The first letters of words spell out the answer.
      - List of animals found around upper Northern area primarily (5) → FAUNA
      - Initially get a good joke (3) → GAG

1. Alternate letters: Every other letter spells out the answer.
      - Young person regularly reading The Beano (4) → TEEN
      - Harmony, say, in act evens out (4) → SYNC
      - Bookmakers work in them risk picking the odds (7) → WRITERS


### Containers and deletions

Containers and deletions are exactly what they sound like. In a container, one word (or string of letters) is put inside another. In a deletion, one or more letters is removed from a string. For instance:

> - Told about mouthpiece having a brain (8)
> - Embryos right to be included in valuable items (5)
> - Entertainer is most grating without tail (4)

respectively clue: REMINDED (MIND in REED), GERMS (R in GEMS) and HOST (HOARSEST missing ARSE).

Containers are typically clued with words such as "about", "around", "surrounding", "outside", "inside", "having", and "held".

Deletions are typically clued with words such as "losing", "taken (away)", "cutting", "not", "erased", and "dropping out". Sometimes, deletions can indicate position of what to be taken away rather than the letters themselves:

- Words missing their first letters: beheaded, first off, needing no introduction, etc.
- Words missing their last letters: curtailed, abridged, falling short, endless, etc.
- Words missing their first and last letters: unlimited, losing margins, etc.
- Words missing their middle letters: cored, disheartened, hollow, heartless, etc.


### Soundalike clues

There are two common types of sound clues: homophones and spoonerisms. Examples of homophone clues are:

> - I heard celebrity was lazy (8)
> - Reported quality level for fruit (6)

which clue IDLE (homophone of IDOL) and CARROT (homophone of KARAT).

Homophones are indicated with words or phrases suggesting sound, like "to the audience", "over the phone", "on the radio", "overheard", "in audition", "they said", "to the ear", etc.

Named after Reverend William Spooner, a spoonerism is a transposal of the starting sounds of two words in a phrase (e.g. from "well-oiled bicycle" to "well-boiled icicle", or from "jelly beans" to "belly jeans"), such as:

> - Spooner’s cheerful enthusiast? He’ll get you across (8)
> - Rev. Spooner’s pet’s entry to working-class symbol (4, 3)

which clue FERRYMAN (from MERRY FAN) and FLAT CAP (from CAT FLAP).


### Anagrams

In anagram clues, the letters to be anagrammed must come directly from the clue. Clues where you have synonyms leading to the word(s) to be anagrammed are called “indirect anagrams” and are typically prohibited in cryptic crosswords. Most anagram indicators can be classified into the following categories.

- Change: developing, rewritten, curing, altered
- Oddity: odd, weird, strange, bizarre
- Falsehood: false, unnatural, criminal
- Novelty: exceptional, special, novel
- Worsening: worse, sick, lousy
- Destruction: split, broken, blasted
- Disorder: messy, dirty, scattered, chaotic
- Delirium: mad, wild, crazy, lunatic, insane - Movement: vagrant, running, dancing
- Adaptation: version of, manifestation of, rendition of
- Correctness: straight, correct, perfect

Examples of anagram clues include:

> - Bizarre triangle is a tool used in calculus (8)
> - Accepting talent or insane (8)

cluing INTEGRAL and TOLERANT.



### &Lit
In an &Lit clue (meaning “and literally so”), the definition and subsidiary indication are one and the same. These clues are usually unindicated, but occasionally given an exclamation point at the end. For example:

> - Preserved over millennia - pumice erupted - immortally Italian, primarily! (7)
> - Cast, or characters in play! (6)
> - Russia, reorganized after abolishing last traces of Nikolai and Alexandra! (4, abbr.)

clue POMPEII (acrostic), ACTORS (anagram of CAST OR) and USSR (anagram of RUSSIA without last letters of NIKOLAI and ALEXANDRA).
