### Before we begin...

This is a follow-up post! In a [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/12/08/Phantom-Act-1/), I reviewed Act 1 of _The Phantom of the Opera_, and shared my thoughts on seeing a live performance of the musical. This post is a continuation of that, where focus will be shifted to the second act instead.

Like the last post, this will be a relatively detailed review, which, as always, comes with a...

<b>SPOILER ALERT!</b>
<br>
In this article, I'll be going through pretty much every scene in Act 2 of <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> from start to finish, often including excerpts from the show.

With that said, let Act Two begin!


### Entr'acte / Masquerade / Why So Silent?

The orchestra plays an invigorating medley as an entr'acte piece, and the curtain once again rises to commence the second act of the show. We open on New Year's Eve, in a masquerade ball organised by the Paris Opera House.

This is promptly followed by a group number --- Masquerade, where the Opera Populaire's cast and crew are shown dancing and prancing all over the place. Christine and Raoul reveal that they've been engaged, and the rest of the crowd delightfully welcomes a fresh new year as the Phantom has appeared to go on a hiatus for the past few months.

Truth be told, I'm not particularly impressed with this number as performed in the 2011 proshot. Don't get me wrong: The music is stirring, and the lyrics are filled to the brim with carefully constructed parallelism and thought-provoking double meanings. In spite of this, the costumes and the lighting both had a predominantly lilac hue, and the scene simply ended up looking like an overwhelming, dynamic yet heliotrope-tinted sea of indiscernible monotony.

Fortunately, the live production solved this monochromatic issue by switching to a more desaturated lighting in a way that accentuates the vividly coloured and almost kaleidoscopic costumes. The choreography also appeared a lot neater and more cohesive.

In terms of the music itself, you would think that the score and the instrumental should be consistent in both performances. And yet, the live performance of this number still manages to surprise me somehow. This is with regards to the use of percussion on stage. Both performances featured the cast holding cymbals, triangles and other purcussive instruments, but they weren't always audible in the film. I always thought this was due to the use of silent props, which are often utilised in movies and TV. However, in the live performance, you can actually hear the cymbals and triangles being played, demonstrating that they aren't just for show. In hindsight though, it wouldn't make sense for a sound crew to mike up an ensemble member just to capture audio from a tiny handheld instrument.

The joyful promenade ends abruptly as the Phantom emerges out of apparently nowhere, masqueraded as the Red Death (an ominous title character of [an Edgar Allan Poe story](https://poemuseum.org/the-masque-of-the-red-death/){:target="_blank"}). Solemnly he descends the staircase, establishing dominion over the crowd scared stiff. He declares that he has written an original opera Don Juan Triumphant and threatens the Opera House to produce it with Christine as the lead.

The Phantom's stage presence in this scene is unbelievable. The Red Death costume is extremely elaborate and detailed, and I really appreciate how each step he takes on the staircase perfectly aligns with the deep strikes of the orchestra's bass drum.

The Phantom vanishes, and the petrified crowd quickly turns into a riot. Galvanised by this, Raoul pressures Madame Giry into disclosing what she nows about the mysterious Opera Ghost. Though hesitant at first, she promptly gives in and uncovers his backstory.

> **MADAME GIRY:** Very well. It was years ago. There was a travelling fair in the city. Tumblers, conjurors, human
oddities. And there was --- I shall never forget him --- a man
locked in a cage.
>
> **RAOUL:** A cage?
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** A prodigy, monsieur; scholar, architect, musician...
>
> **RAOUL:** A composer...
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** And an inventor too, monsieur. _(...)_
>
> **RAOUL:** _(fretfully)_ Who was this man?
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** A freak of nature more monster than man...
>
> **RAOUL:** Deformed?
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** From birth, it seemed. _(...)_ And then, he went missing. He escaped. They never found him; it was said he had died.
>
> **RAOUL:** But he didn't die, did he?




### Notes / Twisted Every Way

In the office, the managers complain about the nonsensical opera score, and become even more enraged as they read a couple of letters of advice sent in by the Phantom.

> **ANDRÉ:** _(reading the Phantom's letter)_<br>
> Dear Andre, re my orchestrations: <br>
> We need another first bassoon.<br>
> Every note's overblown<br>
> And that third trombone<br>
> Has to go ---<br>
> The man could not be deafer, so please preferably one who plays in tune!<br>
>
> **FIRMIN:** _(reading the Phantom's letter)_<br>
> Dear Firmin, vis-à-vis my opera:<br>
> Some chorus members must be sacked.<br>
> If you could find out which<br>
> Has a sense of pitch;<br>
> Wisely though,<br>
> I've managed to assign a rather minor role to those who cannot act!

I think a bassoon was heard during “dear Andre re my orchestrations, we need another third bassoon”

In Notes, you can hear Phantom’s (pre-recorded) voice throughout and from different parts of the theatre. You can’t really be certain where he is
