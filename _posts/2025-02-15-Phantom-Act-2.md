### Before we begin...

This is a follow-up post! In a [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/12/08/Phantom-Act-1/), I reviewed Act 1 of _The Phantom of the Opera_, and shared my thoughts on seeing a live performance of the musical. This post is a continuation of that, where focus will be shifted to the second act instead.

Like the last post, this will be a relatively detailed review, which, as always, comes with a...

<div style="text-align: center; border: 3px solid var(--theme-color); border-radius: 5px; background: var(--theme-color-light); padding: 15px; margin: 10px;">
<b>SPOILER ALERT!</b>
<br>
In this article, I'll be going through pretty much every scene in Act 2 of <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> from start to finish, often including excerpts from the show.
</div>

With that said, let Act Two begin!


### Entr'acte / Masquerade / Why So Silent?

The orchestra plays an invigorating medley as an entr'acte piece, and the curtain rises to commence the second act of the show. We open on New Year's Eve, in a masquerade ball organised by the Paris Opera House.

This is promptly followed by a group number --- Masquerade, where the Opera Populaire's cast and crew are shown dancing and prancing all over the place. Christine and Raoul reveal that they've been engaged, and the rest of the crowd delightfully welcomes a fresh new year as the Phantom has appeared to go on a hiatus for the past few months.

Truth be told, I'm not particularly impressed with this number as performed in the 2011 proshot. Don't get me wrong: The music is stirring, and the lyrics are filled to the brim with carefully constructed parallelism and thought-provoking double meanings. In spite of this, the costumes and the lighting both had a predominantly lilac hue, and the scene simply ended up looking like an overwhelming, dynamic yet heliotrope-tinted sea of indiscernible monotony.

Fortunately, the live production solved this monochromatic issue by switching to a more desaturated lighting in a way that accentuates the vividly coloured and almost kaleidoscopic costumes. The choreography also appeared a lot neater and more cohesive.

In terms of the music itself, you would think that the score and the instrumental should be consistent in both performances. And yet, the live performance of this number still manages to surprise me somehow. This is with regards to the use of percussion on stage. Both performances featured the cast holding cymbals, triangles and other purcussive instruments, but they weren't always audible in the film. I always thought this was due to the use of silent props, which are often utilised in movies and TV. However, in the live performance, you can actually hear the cymbals and triangles being played, demonstrating that they aren't just for show. In hindsight though, it wouldn't make sense for a sound crew to mike up an ensemble member just to capture audio from a tiny handheld instrument.

The joyful promenade ends abruptly as the Phantom emerges out of apparently nowhere, masqueraded as the Red Death (an ominous title character of [an Edgar Allan Poe story](https://poemuseum.org/the-masque-of-the-red-death/){:target="_blank"}). Solemnly he descends the staircase, establishing dominion over the crowd scared stiff. He declares that he has written an original opera Don Juan Triumphant and threatens the Opera House to produce it with Christine as the lead.

The Phantom's stage presence in this scene is unbelievable. The Red Death costume is extremely elaborate and detailed, and I really appreciate how each step he takes on the staircase perfectly aligns with the deep strikes of the orchestra's bass drum.

The Phantom vanishes, and the petrified crowd quickly turns into a riot. Galvanised by this, Raoul pressures Madame Giry into disclosing what she nows about the mysterious Opera Ghost. Though hesitant at first, she promptly gives in and uncovers his backstory.

> **MADAME GIRY:** Very well. It was years ago. There was a travelling fair in the city. Tumblers, conjurors, human
oddities. And there was --- I shall never forget him --- a man
locked in a cage.
>
> **RAOUL:** A cage?
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** A prodigy, monsieur; scholar, architect, musician...
>
> **RAOUL:** A composer...
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** And an inventor too, monsieur. _(...)_
>
> **RAOUL:** _(fretfully)_ Who was this man?
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** A freak of nature more monster than man...
>
> **RAOUL:** Deformed?
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** From birth, it seemed. _(...)_ And then, he went missing. He escaped. They never found him; it was said he had died.
>
> **RAOUL:** But he didn't die, did he?




### Notes / Twisted Every Way

In the office, the managers complain about the nonsensical opera score, and become even more enraged as they read a couple of letters of advice sent in by the Phantom.

> **ANDRÉ:** _(reading the Phantom's letter)_<br>
> Dear André, re my orchestrations <br>
> We need another first bassoon<br>
> Every note's overblown<br>
> And that third trombone<br>
> Has to go<br>
> The man could not be deafer, so please preferably one who plays in tune!<br>
>
> **FIRMIN:** _(reading the Phantom's letter)_<br>
> Dear Firmin, vis-à-vis my opera<br>
> Some chorus members must be sacked<br>
> If you could find out which<br>
> Has a sense of pitch<br>
> Wisely though<br>
> I've managed to assign a rather minor role to those who cannot act!

I love how a bassoon from the orchestra can be heard during the "another first bassoon" line.

Later, Carlotta and Piangi burst into the room, protesting against the unfair casting decisions and suggesting that this was all a ruse to help Christine. Christine denies this and states that she too refuses to take part in this production. The discourse becomes increasingly rapid and chaotic, but soon grinds to a halt as Madame Giry presents another note from the Opera Ghost.

> **MADAME GIRY:** _(reading the Phantom's letter)_ Fondest greetings to you all. A few instructions just before rehearsal starts: Carlotta must be taught to act...
>
> **PHANTOM'S VOICE:** _(taking over)_<br>
> ...not her normal trick of strutting round the stage<br>
> Our Don Juan must lose some weight<br>
> It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age<br>
> And my managers must learn that their place is in an office, not the arts
> 
> As for Miss Christine Daaé, no doubt she'll do her best --- it's true her voice is good. She knows, though, should she wish to excel she has much still to learn, if pride will let her return to me, her teacher.

In this classily written roast session, the Phantom's (pre-recorded) voice can be heard floating and swirling around in three-dimensional space, almost as if the character is teleporting betwen different parts of the theatre as he sings. This is somewhat reminiscent of those 3D stereo binaural recordings, which I think is a brilliant touch that adds to the character's mystique.

Afterwards, a lightbulb goes off in Raoul's head and he proposes to the managers a plan for ousting and, in a sense, exorcising the Opera Ghost.

> **RAOUL:** We shall play his game --- perform his work but remember we hold the ace! For, if Miss Daae sings, he is certain to attend.
>
> **ANDRÉ:** We make certain the doors are barred!
>
> **FIRMIN:** We make certain our men are there!
>
> **RAOUL:** We make certain they're armed!
>
> **TOGETHER:** The curtain falls! His reign will end!

Tensions rise as both Christine and Madame Giry oppose to the plan, with the former especially torn between ridding the disturbing spirit and protecting her musical mentor. Christine leaves the office anxiously, leaving Raoul to furiously declare:

> **RAOUL:** So --- it is to be war between us! But this time my clever friend, the disaster will be yours!

We are then transported to the rehearsal room, where the cast practises some of the tunes from Don Juan Triumphant, albeit somewhat reluctantly. As usual, Piangi consistently butchers one of his notes. At one point, the choir interrupts Piangi by jointly (and sassily) singing the correct note --- a gag that was unfortunately missed in the 25th anniversary performance.



### Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again / Wandering Child

In the next scene, we see Christine trudge along the stage. She sings a callback to the first verse of The Phantom of the Opera and Little Lotte from Act 1, before entering a graveyard. She wanders a bit further, and finally stops in front of a gravestone with four letters clearly engraved: Daaé.

Grieving over her late father, Christine laments how "passing bells and sculpted angels" make for ill-fitting resting place for someone who is warm, gentle and friendly. She expresses her desire to be reunited with him, even though she knows that this is impossible. Personally, I've got no notes for this part of the show --- both Christines performed it equally emotionally and poignantly.

Afterwards, the Phantom appears and attempts to once again hypnotise Christine into thinking he is her Angel of Music.

> **PHANTOM:** Wandering child, so lost, so helpless, yearning for my guidance!
>
> **CHRISTINE:** Angel or father, friend or phantom --- who is it there staring?
>
> **PHANTOM:** Have you forgotten your Angel?
>
> **CHRISTINE:** Angel, oh speak: What endless longings echo in this whisper?

I like how in this scene the Phantom straight up stands on Christine's father's gravestone, thereby symbolically establishing himself as an authoritative father figure --- one that's simultaneously commanding and amiable; deeply comforting yet infinitely possessive.

The next part is perhaps one of the most beautiful moments of the show: Raoul emerges from the shadows, spots the Phantom hypnotising Christine and tries to put an end to this misery.

> **PHANTOM:** Too long you've wandered in winter...
>
> **RAOUL:** Once again she is his...
>
> **PHANTOM:** Far from my fathering gaze...
>
> **RAOUL:** Once again she returns!
>
> **CHRISTINE:** Wildly my mind beats against you...
> 
> **PHANTOM:** You resist...
>
> **PHANTOM/CHRISTINE:** ...yet your/my soul obeys!

What follows is a beautiful three-part polyphony, with three streams of melody fluctuating between attraction and repulsion, as if they're making every effort to resist intertwining but are ultimately interwoven regardless.

The Phantom continues his hypnosis as the gates guarding the grave magically open. Raoul repeatedly interrupts him, pulling Christine out of her trance. Wrathful (and perhaps covetous), the Phantom hurls streaks of fire at the couple, calling himself the Angel of Death. The pair dodges the fireballs and narrowly escapes, leaving the Phantom to exclaim in rage:

> **PHANTOM:** So be it --- now let it be war upon you both! _(The stage erupts into flame.)_

I cannot overstate how staggeringly powerful this scene is to see in person. I thought the opening of the gates, which wasn't featured in the proshot, was a clever design decision; but that was immediately overshadowed by the insane pyrotechnics that followed. I don't use the word "insane" a lot, but when dozens of flame projectors are all triggered at the same time to produce extraordinarily intense pillars of fire in a way that you can actually sense the overwhelming heat on your face (and have to make conscious effort not to blink), I think "insane" is certainly an apt description.



### Don Juan Triumphant

We are then shown the night of the premiere of Don Juan Triumphant, where Raoul tells a marksman to wait in the orchestral pit and shoot only "when the time comes".

> **PHANTOM'S VOICE:** I'm here, the Phantom of the Opera.
>
> _(This line is repeated several times, with the voice seeming to mysteriously dart form place to place.)_
>
> **RAOUL:** _(to the marksman)_ Hold the fire.
>
> _(The Phantom continues to shout "I'm here" from different parts of the theatre, before finally appearing briefly in Box Five. The marksman fires a shot towards the box.)_
>
> **RAOUL:** Idiot! I said only when the time comes!

| Differences | On screen | On stage |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| The marksman | The marksman is supposedly "in the pit", even though the orchestra is really positioned above the stage in the Royal Albert Hall. | The marksman actually stands in the proper orchestral pit. |
| The misfire | As the Phantom shouts "I'm here", Raoul gestures to the marksman not to fire just yet. | Raoul says the words "hold the fire" out loud. Also, the Phantom can be seen (not just heard) entering and then quickly leaving Box 5, which explains why the marksman is inclined to shoot specifically at this specific instant. |

Anyways, the cast soon begins their performance of Don Juan Triumphant. But first...

<p>
    <span style="font-weight: 700;">We interrupt this broadcast to bring you this tangent:</span>
    <span style="font-weight: 900;">Who is Don Juan?</span>
</p>

<p>
    Don Juan is a rather well-known Spanish legend with lots of adaptations over the years, most notably Mozart's opera Don Giovanni. The plot details and character names vary between different adaptations, but they all revolve around (more or less) the same premise:
</p>

<div class="indent">
    <p style="font-style: italic;">
        A carefree libertine Don Juan (a.k.a. Don Giovanni) enjoys seducing women from all walks of life, sometimes even resorting to disguising himself as a completely different person to do so.
    </p>
</div>


<p>
    Have a look at the libretto near the start of Act II in Mozart's Don Giovanni. Here, Don Giovanni is convincing his servant, Leporello, to swap clothes with him so that he can seduce a maid he came across.
</p>

<div class="indent">
    <p>
        <b>DON GIOVANNI:</b>
        <span class="don-giovanni-it">
            Lasciar le donne‽ Sai ch'elle per me son necessarie più del pan che mangio, più dell'aria che spiro! <i>(...)</i> Vedesti tu la cameriera di Donna Elvira?
        </span>
        <span class="don-giovanni-en">
            Forgo the women‽ You know they are necessary for me, more than the bread that I eat, more than the air that I breathe! <i>(...)</i> Did you see Donna Elvira's maid?

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>LEPORELLO:</b>
        <span class="don-giovanni-it">
            Io, no.
        </span>
        <span class="don-giovanni-en">
            No, I didn't.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>DON GIOVANNI:</b>
        <span class="don-giovanni-it">
            Non hai veduto qualche cosa di bello, caro il mio Leporello. Ora io con lei vo' tentar la mia sorte; ed ho pensato, giacché siam verso sera, per aguzzarle meglio l'appetito di presentarmi a lei col tuo vestito.

        <span class="don-giovanni-en">

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>LEPORELLO:</b>
        <span class="don-giovanni-it">

        <b>DON GIOVANNI:</b>
        <span class="don-giovanni-it">

Now back to our scheduled programming. Like in Mozart's opera, the Phantom's Don Juan Triumphant sees the protagonist disguise as his servant Passarino in an attempt to seduce a maid he invited for dinner. Here, Don Juan is played by Piangi and the maid is played by Christine.

Sure enough, Don Juan goes offstage to swap clothes with Passarino. By the time he returns to the stage, he's already wearing Passarino's cloak, which covers his entire body from head to toe. However, it's not just his appearance that's changed --- listen closely and you will find that Don Juan is somehow no longer played by Piangi, but by the Phantom instead.



### The Point of No Return

The devastation in the Bridge is crossed
Towards the end of PONR, the Phantom is confronted by a couple of shooters. He tries to leave the stage, but is surrounded by Raoul and the managers. Christine gestures with her hand not to shoot the Phantom, before Phantom sings All I Ask of You and Christine his ring, which shines in the spotlight.
