_In [last week's write-up]({{ site.baseurl }}/A-Compiler-That-Only-Outputs-CVs/), I introduced a [Résumé Compiler](https://github.com/raphaellith/Resume-Compiler) that I created specifically to write CVs with greater efficiency. Its opening paragraph, which offered a fairly despondent view at the notion of composing résumés, went through at least three distinct drafts with varying degrees of verbosity, before it was ultimately trimmed down lest it prove overly distracting or out of place. Here is the original version of the rant, in its unabridged entirety._

There is something deeply dystopian about having to write a CV. The abbreviated term, which seems overwhelmingly ubiquitous in the world of job seeking, stands for "curriculum vitae", Latin for "course of one's life". This is almost an etymological irony: If you are asked to produce a summary or indeed a résumé of the course of your life, the last thing you would do is to typeset your catalogue of milestones, however awe-inspiringly impressive or idiosyncratically representative, in 11-point monochromatic Times New Roman. How unbearably trite and unbelievably monotonous does one's existence have to be for its textual rendition to be so visually bland and petrifyingly brief? Autobiographies are multifaceted and multidimensional; constraining them to a standardised sheet of paper would be an utter indignity to the individual in question.

"But CVs aren't biographies," I hear you cry. "Biographies are a depiction of life; CVs are an account of work." This is certainly a valid counterargument, but it would also imply that résumés are not synopses but excerpts. In other words, whatever is described in one's résumé will never be one's true self, but a biased and insubstantial cross-section of it. Would you judge the volume of an object merely by the size of its shadow? To write a résumé is to create an abstraction, eliminating the apparently immaterial attributes before distilling the remainder into a hollow, bare and no longer recognisable self. To distill is to purify, and to purify is to strip away the so-called impurities that make one oneself.
