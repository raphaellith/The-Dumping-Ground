Like the ones presented in the previous post, the puzzles in this post are inspired by (and have the same format as) the BBC quiz show Only Connect. This time, however, the puzzles are based on the show's second round: Sequences.

Like last time, below are six puzzles waiting for you to solve. Each puzzle consists of four clues that form some sort of sequence, but you may only see up to three of them. Your goal is to work out what the fourth and final item is.

- In each puzzle, the first clue is automatically shown.
- Click on any of the currently displayed clues to reveal the next one.
- Once the third clue has been revealed, a fourth box containing a question mark will appear, prompting you to make your guess as to what the fourth item in the sequence is. After that, clicking again will display the answer.
- Generally speaking, the fewer clues you need to figure out the correct answer, the better.

For instance, a puzzle may have the clues

> 1. <span class="ff-din"> November</span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> Alpha</span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> Tango </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> ? </span>
> <div style="text-align: right">(from <i>Only Connect</i>, Series 3, Episode 3)</div>

and have the answer **Oscar**. The four clues collectively spell out the abbreviation NATO using the NATO phonetic alphabet.

Another example might be

> 1. <span class="ff-din"> Season of Light </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> Season of Darkness </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> Spring of Hope </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> ? </span>
> <div style="text-align: right">(from <i>Only Connect</i>, Series 8, Episode 1)</div>

which has the answer **Winter of Despair**, from the opening sentence of Dickens' _A Tale of Two Cities_.

There might be multiple acceptable answers for the same sequence. Take the following sequence as an example.

> 1. <span class="ff-din"> MasterCard </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> Rubik's Magic </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> Audi </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> ? </span>
> <div style="text-align: right">(from <i>Only Connect</i>, Series 6, Episode 4)</div>

The logos for MasterCard, Rubik's Magic and Audi contain 2, 3 and 4 overlapping circles respectively. This means that the answer is just anything that consists of 5 overlapping circles, such as the **Olympic flag**.

Here's one last example:

> 1. <span class="ff-din"> A: First sign of the zodiac </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> B: De Meaux and de Melun</span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> C: Weeps </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> ? </span>
> <div style="text-align: right">(from <i>Only Connect</i>, Series 20, Episode 1)</div>

The first three clues are synonyms of ARIES, BRIES and CRIES respectively. Following this sequence, the final item must be some paraphrasing of the word DRIES, like **D: Loses moisture**.

Good luck and have fun with the ones below! (And if you're reading this on your phone, try tilting your device sideways for the best experience!)
