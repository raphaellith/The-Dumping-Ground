This is going to be a really nerdy article based on a relatively niche interest of mine, so I'm going to try and keep it as short as possible.

Taskmaster is one of my favourite British TV shows. The programme is the brainchild of comedian Alex Horne, who co-presents the show alongside Greg Davies. Its premise is simple:

> I'm Greg Davies and I am the Taskmaster. Five funny people have been set a load of ludicrous tasks that we have filmed them attempting to complete. Over the ten episodes of the series, I will pass judgements on their efforts from this --- a magnificent throne. At the end of the tenth episode, the person who has amassed the most points across the run will take home the ultimate prize: my beautiful head cast in solid gold!
>
> And next to me, the man whose job it is to keep track of all the facts and figures --- he's been my personal assistant for coming up to six years --- it's Little Alex Horne!
>
> <div style="text-align: right">(adapted from Series 10, Episode 1 of <i>Taskmaster</i>)</div>

It's difficult to give an accurate description of Taskmaster without sharing a concrete example of its tasks, so here are a couple of quintessential challenges that have appeared on the show in the past.

<div class="task">
Copy Alex.<br>
Alex will demonstrate his actions twice, then you will have one attempt to copy Alex.<br>
Closest copy wins.<br>
Your time starts now.<br><br>

</div>

<div class="task">
Pile the pineapples on the path.<br>
You must not get wet.<br>
Most pineapples piled on the path wins.<br>
You have fifteen minutes.<br>
Your time starts now.<br><br>

<div class="task">
Make the most exotic sandwich.<br>
You have ten minutes to plan your exotic sandwich and then ten minutes to construct it.<br>

A few months ago saw the announcement of an interactive and immersive version of Taskmaster where visitors are offered the chance to engage in a bunch of ridiculous and humorous tasks, akin to the ones featured on the show. Being a fan of the show myself, I decided to try it out on my 18th birthday as a way of indulging my interest in televised game shows.


### The Tasks


I don't want to spoil any of the tasks featured in the experience, partly because I can't really remember the exact wording of each task, but also because that's not in the spirit of the game. I will say though:

- The first task was a variation of a live task from Series 3. Despite it being not entirely brand new, the mind-games-esque nature of the task meant that manipulation, deception, psychological influence and game theory are all on the table, which opened up tons of possibilities for different outcomes.
- Task 2 was done in a slightly enlarged but nevertheless surprisingly accurately recreation of the Lounge from the Taskmaster House. The task shared a similar vibe with a Series 18 task, where contestants are asked to count the number of seats in a cinema. This was also the task in which I uttered the alternative title for this article --- "should've put a human brain in".
- The third task was carried out in the Lab. This was a team task, and was reminiscent, to some extent, of a task from Series 7, in which contestants were tasked with producing a very specific reading on a set of scales.
- Task 4 was conducted in the Shed, although the recreation was not particularly recognizable at first glance. This was perhaps the most physically demanding and straight-up chaotic task out of the five, and my right arm remained sore for two days after it took place.
- After completing four tasks, the five top-scorers competed in a "live" task on "stage" (which was really a moderately elevated platform). The winner of this task was crowned the Taskmaster champion and was awarded a medal.
- I didn't do particularly well in the first four tasks (I came joint last). As a shot of redemption though, the rest of the participants were given a separate task which ran at the same time as the live task. I was fortunate enough to have won that task and was given the title of the "best of the worst", which came with a golden rubber duck as a prize.

<div class="task">
Say how many chairs are in this cinema.<br>
You may only give one answer.<br>
You must not say any numbers until you give your answer, and you must say the name of every object that appears on the screen.<br>
If you miss an object one minute will be added to your time. For every chair you get wrong one minute will be added to your time.<br>
You have a maximum of ten minutes.<br>
Fastest correct answer wins.<br>
Your time starts when Alex blows his whistle.<br><br>
(Series 18, Episode 10)
</div>

<div class="task">
Make these scales read 31.770 kg.<br>
The scales must read 31.770 kg for at least 5 seconds.<br>
Fastest wins.<br>
Your time starts now.<br><br>
(Series 7, Episode 4)
</div>



### The Museum

In addition to these tasks, part of the venue was used to showcase props, artwork and various memorabilia from past series of the show.









<div class="task">
Make a bridge over the river using only items on this table.<br>
Highest self-supporting bridge wins.<br>
The bridge alone must support the potato.<br>
You must not touch the Taskmaster's house.<br>
You have twenty minutes.<br>
Your time starts now.<br><br>

### The Potato and the Golf Hole

<div class="task">
Get this potato into the golf hole.<br>
You may not touch the red green.<br>
Fastest wins.<br>
Your time starts now.<br><br>
