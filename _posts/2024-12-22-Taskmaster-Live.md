### Taskmaster

Taskmaster is one of my favourite British TV shows. The premise is simple: Each series features five comedians completing a series of unorthodox tasks. The contestants' attempts are overseen by Little Alex Horne, the personal assistant of the titular Taskmaster Greg Davies. The Taskmaster awards points to the contestants based on how well each task is fulfilled, and the one with the highest point total at the end of each series is crowned a Taskmaster champion.

It's hard to give an accurate description of Taskmaster without sharing a few examples of its tasks, so here are a couple of quintessential challenges that have appeared on the show over the past 18 series.

    margin-bottom: 25px;

    font-family: TM;
    text-align: center;
}
