### My first exposure to Phantom

Sometime around November 2023, YouTube recommended to me a video with a rather intriguing thumbnail. It featured a mysterious, half-masked gentleman wearing a sophisticated sable suit, raising his left hand aloft as he gracefully sends a lady, dressed constrastingly in white, into a deep, mesmerizing trance. I didn't think much of it at first, but for the next few weeks or so, the same video has been consistently and temptingly popping up in my feed, to the extent that I could not help but simply click on the video.

That video, posted by the channel _The Shows Must Go On!_, was the concert film adaptation of _The Phantom of the Opera_, the second longest-running West End musical of all time (after _Les Misérables_). Released in 2011, the film marked the 25th anniversary of the musical's 1986 premiere, and was officially titled _The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall_. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the full proshot was released on YouTube free of charge amid theatre closures.

Now, I'm not typically a fan of most fictional media, so when I do discover something that I really enjoy, I tend to become quite obsessed with it (in a healthy way), and this one was no exception. Hooked by the show's enigmatic and captivating premise, I binged through all 2 hours and 41 minutes of the show on my phone (albeit in multiple sittings). Over the past year, I've rewatched the film countless times*, the proshot's soundtrack became my most-streamed album of 2023, and I've even learnt to play the title number on piano.

(*Unfortunately, [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nINQjT7Zr9w){:target="_blank"} got taken down from YouTube at some point and is to this day not accessible to the public, at least not for free. Instead, only [snippets](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRImnjFIgJIWRMkXEoKmaUgW8qihGyRnm&si=CICqYVnIZOYwz_j9){:target="_blank"} from the show are available. That was the day I realized how useful [the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/The_Phantom_of_The_Opera_Full_Stage_Show){:target="_blank"} and [Wayback Machine video downloaders](https://www.waybackyt.download){:target="_blank"} were.)


### Seeing Phantom live on stage

I can neither confirm nor deny whether my ever-growing desire to see this masterpiece of a show in person constituted a tiny part of my motivation to secure an offer to study in the UK. Either way, last month --- almost an entire year after I clicked on that alluring thumbnail --- I finally got to see the musical chef-d'œuvre that is _The Phantom of the Opera_ at His Majesty's Theatre, where the show first premiered 38 years ago.

Full disclosure: Prior to this theatre trip, I spent literal weeks repeatedly telling myself to lower my expectations, that it was going to be nothing like the 2011 proshot, and that it would be an utter trainwreck of a show. And I did this for good reason. When theatres were forced to shut down due to COVID restrictions in 2020, the production company behind Phantom took the opportunity to make modifications to the scenic design, staging, orchestrations and many other aspects of the show --- modifications which apparently not everyone was happy with. Consequently, if you browse through the [r/box5 subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/box5/){:target="_blank"} or look at the comment sections of some then-recent [slime tutorials](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slime+tutorial){:target="_blank"} (like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gKVuKpaCPA){:target="_blank"} or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpkE3haNRQk){:target="_blank"}), you'll occasionally find a couple of negative remarks regarding the musical's post-COVID revival.

> I was so confused because it was as if the whole show was sped up by 1.5x or something. The pauses in the songs and dialogues felt all rushed through, as with the music. _(...)_ I am disappointed with the experience last night, but honestly I'm more baffled than disappointed.

> **From a comment on r/box5:**
>
> I was stunned by how different the production was and how much smaller it felt since they made the changes to the orchestra, the massive reduction of complexity in the scenery during the overture, the new candles during the boat scene, the angel statue...

Having now seen the show myself, I will have to respectfully disagree with most of these commenters' opinions. Without giving too much away, the performance I witnessed that night might be without exaggeration the best thing I've ever seen: the entrancingly stunning set design, the thrilling yet touching score, and the completely flawless casting, together amalgamating to give a brilliantly executed rendition of a heartbreakingly beautiful romantic tragedy. It truly was one of those really memorable experiences where you'll probably never forget it for the rest of your life, but it's so good you still want to document it somewhere just in case.

And this is that document.


### Before we begin...

...please switch off or set your mobile phone to silent. Cameras and other recording devices are not permitted in the auditorium.

Just kidding. But I _do_ want to paint a picture what I'll be talking about in this article. Mostly, I'll be comparing what I saw in the 2011 concert film (which itself may not be an accurate representation of the show pre-COVID) to what I saw on stage, occassionally providing my own analysis of the storyline. I'll be discussing how the proshot shaped my expectations of what's in the musical, and how the live performance met, exceeded or differed from them. For reference, here are the cast lists for both the 2011 film and the performance I attended.

Now, in order for me to dive deep into the nitty-gritty of each scene, I'll have to be able to talk freely about the musical in its entirety, which of course calls for a...

<b>SPOILER ALERT!</b>
<br>
In this article, I'll be going through pretty much every scene in <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> from start to finish. I'll frequently reference the various plot points of the story, often including quotes and lyrics that are directly extracted from the show.
</div>

With that formality done, let's start with the opening scene: the prologue.


### Prologue / Overture

The opening scene of Phantom is proleptic: rather than presenting the plot events in completely chronological order, the play begins by introducing us to the ending of the story. As the audience arrive and are seated at the auditorium, we are greeted by a series of mystifying props placed across the stage, each covered with a sizeable piece of fabric. All of a sudden, a wave of silence comes over the crowd as the lights are dimmed and the actors swiftly take the stage. A bang from the auctioneer's gavel is heard, marking the commencement of the play and transporting us to the stage of the Paris Opera House (also referred to as the Opera Populaire) in 1905.

![The stage setup as viewed before the opening scene begins.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-10-17/Prologue.jpeg){: width="60%" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

"Sold!" the auctioneer cries, as mementos from the Opera House are being auctioned off one by one. Unsurprisingly, a lot of the auctioned items provide foreshadowing of the events that we have yet to see.

> **AUCTIONEER:** Lot 665, ladies and gentlemen: papier-mâché musical box in the shape of a barrel organ. Attached, the figure of a monkey in Persian robes, playing the cymbals. This item, discovered in the vaults of the theatre, still in working order.
>
> **PORTER:** Showing here. _(A melody from Masquerade, a number from later on in the show, plays.)_
>
> **AUCTIONEER:** May I commence at 20 francs? _(No bids are placed.)_ Oh, come come, ladies and gentlemen. Fifteen, then?

To me, the bidders' reluctance plays a big part in demonstrating how monetarily and materially worthless the musical box is. The box, which proved unfamiliar to almost all the bidders, was eventually sold to an old man by the name of Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny. This begs the question: Why?

> **AUCTIONEER:** Lot 666 then: A chandelier in pieces. Some of you may recall the strange affair of The Phantom of the Opera, a mystery never fully explained. We are told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the very chandelier that figures in that famous disaster. Our workshops have restored it and fitted parts of it with wiring for the new electric light, so that we may get a hint of how it may look when reassembled. Perhaps we may even frighten away the ghost of so many years ago, with a little illumination, gentlemen!

Just like the musical box, this monologue is somehow even more sensational when viewed in person. Every time I watch the 2011 recording, I'm totally blown away by the auctioneer's delivery in his introduction to the iconic chandelier, especially the way he projects his voice when authoritatively ordering the "gentlemen" to uncover and light up the chandelier in the final line. Seeing this scene in the flesh is equally if not more astonishing; it definitely lives up to what was shown in the Royal Albert Hall performance.

Immediately after the end of this dramatic monologue, the chandelier is revealed with a couple of flashing fulminations, the stage is once again brightly lit, and the theatre is filled with the hair-raising sound of the famous pipe organ. Energized by the overture's grandiloquent melody, the audience is taken further back in time, to a point where the Opera House is as yet in its prime. (In the film, opening credits are displayed on screen as the overture plays, which is a shame because viewers can't really experience this wondrous multidimensional back-in-time transition in full.)

I cannot overstate how exhilarating it is to listen to the overture performed by an actual orchestra, especially the roaring blast of the organ when it plays the spine-chilling B-flat minor chord at the beginning. You can genuinely feel it in your bones. It was so electrifyingly powerful that --- I wish this was a hyperbole --- I literally could not feel my fingers for the first half of Act 1. Listening to the overture with headphones is one thing; experiencing it in person is undoubtedly another.


### Hannibal Rehearsal / Think of Me

Following the end of our time-travelling journey, the first note we hear is from the Opera House's leading soprano Carlotta, in a rehearsal for an upcoming production of the opera _Hannibal_. Carlotta's performance is supported by, among others, the occassionally inept but stubborn tenor Piangi, who at one point mispronounces his lyrics and is corrected by the Opera House's maestro Monsieur Reyer:

> **PIANGI (as Hannibal):**
> Sad to return to find the land we love, threatened once more by _Roma's_ far-reaching grasp...
>
> **REYER:** No, no, no! Signor, if you please: "Rome". We say "Rome" --- not "Roma"!
>
> _(Piangi argues with Reyer over the anglicization of "Rome" before grudgingly giving in.)_
>
> **PIANGI (as Hannibal):** Sad to return to find the land we love, threatened once more by _Rome's_ far-reaching grasp. Tomorrow we shall break the chains of _Rome_; tonight, rejoice: your army has come home.
>
> _(Rehearsal continues with ballet section.)_

Piangi's debate with Reyer provides an illustration of his obstinacy: He knows good and well what the script says, and nevertheless refuses to submit to the anglicized version of the Italian city's name. Even after being pressured into sticking to the script, he is clearly reluctant in doing so. 

One of the differences I noticed between the performances is how this reluctance is exhibited. In the film, Piangi switches from ```/ˈro.ma/``` to ```/ɹəʊm/``` with a slightly patronizing undertone. In the stage show, the patronization is hardly concealed by Piangi, who quite comedically says ```/ɹəʊmːː/``` with a mockingly long ```/mːː/``` sound at the end.

Another dissimilarity lies in how the rehearsal ends. In the film, Piangi (as Hannibal) is unable to unsheathe his sword from his scabbard, which gives us the impression that this is indeed merely an rehearsal, with a couple of places that are yet to be perfected. In comparison, the live show really upped their schadenfreude game, with Piangi attempting but failing to mount an enormous prop elephant, which is a hilarious sight to behold. Throughout the play, Piangi seems to be main source of comic relief, which I'll come back to later on.

********



After the rehearsal, the owner of the Opera Populaire announces his retirement and introduces the new managers Monsieur Firmin and Monsieur André. Firmin then requests whether Carlotta could perform an aria for him "as a personal favor", to which Carlotta promptly accedes. One verse into the aria though, this happens:

> _(The scenic backdrop on stage falls from the flies unexpectedly, seemingly without explanation.)_
>
> **CHORUS GIRLS:** _(screaming)_ He's there, the Phantom of the Opera!
>
> _(...)_
>
> **FORMER MANAGER:** Buquet! Where is Buquet? Get that man down here. Buquet --- chief of the flies --- he's responsible for this. Buquet! For God's sake, man, what's going on up there?
>
> **BUQUET:** <br>
> Please monsieur don't look at me <br>
> As God's my witness I was not at my post <br>
> Please monsieur there's no one there <br>
> And if there is, well then it must be a ghost!
>
> **CHORUS GIRLS:** He's there, the Phantom of the Opera!

In an attempt to trivialize this apparent accident, Firmin comments that "these things do happen", but is rebutted by Carlotta, who is angered by the fact that the Opera House has long been jinxed by these inexplicable mishaps, and that no one has done anything to stop them. Piangi amusingly calls the managers "amateurs", before storming offstage along with the furious Carlotta.

With the female lead gone, the managers are tasked with finding a stand-in soprano. Both the ballet mistress Madame Giry and her daughter/ballet girl Meg Giry suggests Christine Daaé, a chorus girl who also happens to be the daughter of a well-known violinist, as a replacement.

> **MEG:** Christine Daaé could sing it, sir.
>
> **ANDRE:** A ballet girl?
>
> **MEG:** Well, she's been taking lessons from a great teacher.
>
> **ANDRE:** Oh, from whom?
>
> **CHRISTINE:** I don't know, sir.
>
> _(...)_
>
> **FIRMIN:** Daaé? That's a curious name. Any relation to the violinist?
>
> **CHRISTINE:** My father, sir.
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** Let her sing for you, monsieur. She has been well-taught.

Except... that's not how that conversation went in the live show. Instead of introducing Christine after Carlotta storms off, her introduction was given much earlier in the West End performance, during the Hannibal rehearsal. During the ballet section,
