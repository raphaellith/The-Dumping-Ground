### My first exposure to Phantom

Sometime around November 2023, YouTube recommended to me a video with a rather intriguing thumbnail. It featured a mysterious, half-masked gentleman wearing a sophisticated sable suit, raising his left hand aloft as he gracefully sends a lady, dressed constrastingly in white, into a deep, mesmerizing trance. I didn't think much of it at first; but for the next few weeks or so, the same video has been consistently and temptingly popping up in my feed, to the extent that I could not help but simply click on the video.

That video, posted by Andrew Lloyd Webber's channel _The Shows Must Go On!_, was a concert film adaptation of _The Phantom of the Opera_, the second longest-running West End musical of all time (after _Les Misérables_). Released in 2011, the film marked the 25th anniversary of the musical's 1986 premiere, and was officially titled _The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall_. During the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, the full proshot was released on YouTube free of charge amid theatre closures.

Now, I'm not typically a fan of most fictional media, so when I do discover something that I really enjoy, I tend to become quite obsessed with it (in a healthy way), and this one was no exception. Hooked by the show's enigmatic and captivating premise, I binged through all 2 hours and 41 minutes of the show on my phone (albeit in multiple sittings). Over the past year, I've rewatched the film countless times*, the proshot's soundtrack became my most-streamed album of 2023, and I've even learnt to play the title number on piano.

(*Unfortunately, [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nINQjT7Zr9w){:target="_blank"} got taken down from YouTube at some point and is to this day not accessible to the public, at least not for free. Instead, only [snippets and highlights](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRImnjFIgJIWRMkXEoKmaUgW8qihGyRnm&si=CICqYVnIZOYwz_j9){:target="_blank"} from the show are available. That was the day I realized how useful [the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/The_Phantom_of_The_Opera_Full_Stage_Show){:target="_blank"} and [Wayback Machine video downloaders](https://www.waybackyt.download){:target="_blank"} were.)


### Seeing Phantom live on stage

I can neither confirm nor deny whether my ever-growing desire to see this masterpiece of a show in person constituted a tiny part of my motivation to study harder and secure an offer to study in the UK. Either way, last month --- almost an entire year after I clicked on that alluring thumbnail --- I finally got to see the musical chef-d'œuvre that is _The Phantom of the Opera_ at His Majesty's Theatre, where the show first premiered 38 years ago.

Full disclosure: Prior to this theatre trip, I spent literal weeks repeatedly telling myself to lower my expectations, that it was going to be nothing like the 2011 proshot, and that it would be an utter trainwreck of a show. And I did this for good reason. When theatres were forced to shut down due to COVID restrictions in 2020, the production company behind Phantom took the opportunity to make modifications to the scenic design, staging, orchestrations and many other aspects of the show --- modifications which apparently not everyone was happy with. Consequently, if you browse through the [r/box5 subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/box5/){:target="_blank"} or look at the comment sections of some then-recent [slime tutorials](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slime+tutorial){:target="_blank"} (like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gKVuKpaCPA){:target="_blank"} or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpkE3haNRQk){:target="_blank"}), you'll occasionally find a couple of negative remarks regarding the musical's post-COVID revival.

> I was so confused because it was as if the whole show was sped up by 1.5x or something. The pauses in the songs and dialogues felt all rushed through, as with the music. _(...)_ I am disappointed with the experience last night, but honestly I'm more baffled than disappointed.

> **From a comment on r/box5:**
>
> I was stunned by how different the production was and how much smaller it felt since they made the changes to the orchestra, the massive reduction of complexity in the scenery during the overture, the new candles during the boat scene, the angel statue...

Having now seen the show myself, I will have to respectfully disagree with most of these commenters' opinions. Without giving too much away, the performance I witnessed that night might be without exaggeration the best thing I've ever seen: the entrancingly stunning set design, the thrilling yet touching score, and the completely flawless casting, together amalgamating to give a brilliantly executed rendition of a heartbreakingly beautiful romantic tragedy. It truly was one of those really memorable experiences where you'll probably never forget it for the rest of your life, but it's so good you still want to document it somewhere just in case.

And this is that document.


### Before we begin...

...please switch off or set your mobile phone to silent. Cameras and other recording devices are not permitted in the auditorium.

Just kidding. But I _do_ want to paint a picture what I'll be talking about in this article. Mostly, I'll be comparing what I saw in the 2011 concert film (which itself may not be an accurate representation of the show pre-COVID) to what I saw on stage, occassionally providing my own analysis of the storyline. I'll be discussing how the proshot shaped my expectations of what's in the musical, and how the live performance met, exceeded or differed from them.

Now, in order for me to dive deep into the nitty-gritty of each scene, I'll have to be able to talk freely about the musical in its entirety, which of course calls for a...

<div style="text-align: center; border: 3px solid var(--theme-color); border-radius: 5px; background: var(--theme-color-light); padding: 15px; margin: 10px;">
<b>SPOILER ALERT!</b>
<br>
In this article, I'll be going through pretty much every scene in <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> from start to finish. I'll frequently reference the various plot points of the story, sometimes including quotes and lyrics that are directly extracted from the show.

With that formality done, let's start with the opening scene: the prologue.


### Prologue / Overture

The opening scene of Phantom is proleptic: rather than presenting the plot events in completely chronological order, the play begins by introducing us to the ending of the story. As the audience arrive and are seated at the auditorium, we are greeted by a series of mystifying props placed across the stage, each covered with a sizeable piece of fabric. All of a sudden, a wave of silence comes over the crowd as the lights are dimmed and the actors swiftly take the stage. A bang from the auctioneer's gavel is heard, marking the commencement of the play and transporting us to the stage of the Paris Opera House in 1905.

"Sold!" the auctioneer cries, as mementos from the Opera House are being auctioned off one by one. Unsurprisingly, a lot of the auctioned items provide foreshadowing of the events that we have yet to see.

> **AUCTIONEER**

> Lot 665, ladies and gentlemen: papier-mâché musical box in the shape of a barrel organ. Attached, the figure of a monkey in Persian robes, playing the cymbals. This item, discovered in the vaults of the theatre, still in working order.

> **PORTER**

> Showing here. _(A melody from Masquerade, a number from later on in the show, plays.)_
>
> **AUCTIONEER**
>
> May I commence at 20 francs? _(No bids are placed.)_ Oh, come come, ladies and gentlemen. Fifteen, then?

To me, the bidders' reluctance plays a big part in demonstrating how monetarily and materially worthless the musical box is. The box, which proved unfamiliar to almost all the bidders, was eventually sold to an old man by the name of Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny. This begs the question: Why?

> **AUCTIONEER**
>
> Lot 666 then: A chandelier in pieces. Some of you may recall the strange affair of The Phantom of the Opera, a mystery never fully explained. We are told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the very chandelier that figures in that famous disaster. Our workshops have restored it and fitted parts of it with wiring for the new electric light, so that we may get a hint of how it may look when reassembled. Perhaps we may even frighten away the ghost of so many years ago, with a little illumination, gentlemen!

Just like the musical box, this monologue is somehow even more sensational when viewed in person. Every time I watch the 2011 recording, I'm totally blown away by the auctioneer's delivery in his introduction to the iconic chandelier, especially the way he powerfully and authoritatively orders the "gentlemen" to uncover and light up the chandelier in the last line. Seeing this scene in the flesh is equally if not more astonishing; it definitely lives up to what was shown in the Royal Albert Hall performance.

Immediately after this monologue ends, the chandelier is revealed with a couple of flashing fulminations, the stage is once again brightly lit, and the theatre is filled with the hair-raising sound of an organ. As the overture plays, the now fully illuminated chandelier rises to the ceiling
