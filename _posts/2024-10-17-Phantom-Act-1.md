### My first exposure to Phantom

Sometime around November 2023, YouTube recommended to me a video with a rather intriguing thumbnail. It featured a mysterious, half-masked gentleman wearing a sophisticated sable suit, raising his left hand aloft as he gracefully sends a lady, dressed constrastingly in white, into a deep, mesmerizing trance. I didn't think much of it at first, but for the next few weeks or so, the same video has been consistently popping up in my feed, to the extent that I could not help but simply click on it.

That video, posted by the channel _The Shows Must Go On!_, was in fact a proshot of _The Phantom of the Opera_, the second longest-running West End musical of all time (after _Les Misérables_). Released in 2011, the concert film marked the musical's 25th anniversary, and was officially titled _The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall_. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the full recording was released on YouTube free of charge amid theatre closures.

Now, I'm not typically a fan of fictional media, so when I do discover something that I really enjoy, I tend to become quite obsessed with it (in a healthy way), and this one was no exception. Hooked by the show's enigmatic and captivating premise, I binged through all 2 hours and 41 minutes of the show on my phone (albeit in multiple sittings). Over the past year, I've rewatched the film countless times*, the proshot's soundtrack became my most-streamed album of 2023, and I've even learnt to play the title number on piano.

(*Unfortunately, [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nINQjT7Zr9w){:target="_blank"} got taken down from YouTube at some point and is to this day not accessible to the public, at least not for free. Instead, only [snippets from the show](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRImnjFIgJIWRMkXEoKmaUgW8qihGyRnm&si=CICqYVnIZOYwz_j9){:target="_blank"} are available. That was the day I realized how useful [the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/The_Phantom_of_The_Opera_Full_Stage_Show){:target="_blank"} and [Wayback Machine video downloaders](https://www.waybackyt.download){:target="_blank"} were.)


### Seeing Phantom live on stage

I can neither confirm nor deny whether my ever-growing desire to see this masterpiece of a show in person constituted a tiny part of my motivation to secure an offer to study in the UK. Either way, last month --- almost an entire year after I clicked on that alluring thumbnail --- I finally got to see the musical chef-d'œuvre that is _The Phantom of the Opera_ at His Majesty's Theatre, where the show first premiered 38 years ago.

Full disclosure: Prior to this theatre trip, I spent literal weeks repeatedly telling myself to lower my expectations, that it was going to be nothing like the 2011 proshot, and that it would be an utter trainwreck of a show. And I did this for good reason. When theatres were forced to shut down due to COVID restrictions in 2020, the production company behind Phantom took the opportunity to modify the scenic design, staging, orchestrations and many other aspects of the show. Apparently, not everyone was happy with these changes, and if you browsed through the comment sections of some then-recent [slime tutorials](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slime+tutorial){:target="_blank"} like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gKVuKpaCPA){:target="_blank"} or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpkE3haNRQk){:target="_blank"}, you'd occasionally find a fair number of negative remarks regarding the musical's post-COVID revival: actors rushing through their lines, underwhelming orchestrations and oversimplified staging, to name but a few.

Having now seen the show myself, I will have to respectfully disagree with some of these commenters' opinions. Without giving too much away, the performance I witnessed that night might be without exaggeration the best thing I've ever seen: the entrancingly stunning set design, the thrilling yet touching score, and the realistic but nonetheless emotive acting, together amalgamating to give a brilliantly executed rendition of a heartbreakingly beautiful romantic tragedy. It truly was one of those really memorable experiences where you'll probably never forget it for the rest of your life, but it's so good you still want to document it somewhere just in case.

And this is that document.


### Before we begin...

...please switch off or set your phone to silent. Cameras and recording devices are not permitted here.

Just kidding. But I _do_ want to paint a picture what I'll be talking about in this article.

Mostly, I'll be comparing what I saw in the 2011 concert film to what I saw on stage, occassionally providing my own analysis of the storyline. I'll be discussing how the proshot shaped my expectations of what's in the musical, and how the live performance met, exceeded or differed from them.

Note how there's a gap in both time and space between these two performances. I know that the 2011 proshot may not be an accurate representation of the show pre-COVID, and that the script has evolved considerably during the last 13 years. Nevertheless, I will _only_ be comparing these two specific performances that I saw --- no more and no less.

Now, in order for me to dive deep into the nitty-gritty of each scene, I'll have to be able to talk freely about the musical in its entirety, which of course calls for a...

<b>SPOILER ALERT!</b>
<br>
In this article, I'll be going through pretty much every scene in <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> from start to finish. I'll frequently reference the various plot points of the story, often including excerpts from the show.
</div>

With that formality done, let's start with the opening scene: the prologue.


### Prologue / Overture

The opening scene of Phantom is proleptic: rather than presenting the plot events in completely chronological order, the play begins by introducing us to the ending of the story. As the audience arrive and are seated at the auditorium, we are greeted by a series of mystifying props placed across the stage, each covered with a sizeable piece of fabric. All of a sudden, a wave of silence comes over the crowd as the lights are dimmed and the actors swiftly take the stage. A bang from the auctioneer's gavel is heard, marking the commencement of the play and transporting us to the stage of the Paris Opera House (a.k.a. the Opera Populaire) in 1905.

![The stage setup as viewed before the opening scene begins.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-10-17/Prologue.jpeg){: width="60%" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}

"Sold!" the auctioneer cries, as mementos from the Opera House are purchased one by one. A lot of these auctioned items, unsurprisingly, provide foreshadowing of the events that we'll see later.

> **AUCTIONEER:** Lot 665, ladies and gentlemen: papier-mâché musical box in the shape of a barrel organ. Attached, the figure of a monkey in Persian robes, playing the cymbals. This item, discovered in the vaults of the theatre, still in working order.
>
> **PORTER:** Showing here. _(A melody from Masquerade, a number from later on in the show, plays.)_
>
> **AUCTIONEER:** May I commence at 20 francs? _(No bids are placed.)_ Oh, come come, ladies and gentlemen. Fifteen, then?

To me, the bidders' reluctance plays a big part in demonstrating how monetarily and materially worthless the musical box is. The box, which proved unfamiliar to almost all the bidders, was eventually sold to an old man by the name of Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny. This begs the question: Why would Raoul want such a valueless trinket?

> **AUCTIONEER:** Lot 666 then: A chandelier in pieces. Some of you may recall the strange affair of The Phantom of the Opera, a mystery never fully explained. We are told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the very chandelier that figures in that famous disaster. Our workshops have restored it and fitted parts of it with wiring for the new electric light, so that we may get a hint of how it may look when reassembled. Perhaps we may even frighten away the ghost of so many years ago, with a little illumination, gentlemen!

Just like the musical box, this monologue is somehow even more sensational when viewed in person. Every time I watch the 2011 recording, I'm totally blown away by the auctioneer's delivery in his introduction to the iconic chandelier, especially the way he projects his voice when authoritatively ordering the "gentlemen" to uncover and light up the chandelier in the final line. Seeing this scene in the flesh is equally if not more astonishing; it definitely lives up to what was shown in the Royal Albert Hall performance.

Immediately after the end of this dramatic monologue, the chandelier is revealed with flashing fulminations, the stage is once again brightly lit, and the theatre is filled with the hair-raising sound of the famous pipe organ. Energized by the overture's grandiloquent melody, the audience is taken further back in time, to a point where the Opera House is as yet in its prime. (In the film, opening credits are displayed on screen as the overture plays, which is a shame because viewers can't really experience this wondrous multidimensional back-in-time transition in full.)

I cannot overstate how exhilarating it is to listen to the overture performed by an actual orchestra, especially the roaring blast of the organ when it plays the spine-chilling B-flat minor chord at the beginning. You can genuinely feel it in your bones. It was so electrifyingly powerful that --- I wish this was a hyperbole --- I literally could not feel my fingers for the first half of Act 1. Listening to the overture with headphones is one thing; experiencing it in person is undoubtedly another.


### Hannibal Rehearsal

Following the end of our time-travelling journey, the first note we hear is from the Opera House's leading soprano Carlotta, in a rehearsal for an upcoming production of the opera Hannibal. Carlotta's performance is supported by, among others, the occassionally inept but stubborn tenor Piangi, who at one point mispronounces his lyrics and is corrected by the Opera House's maestro Monsieur Reyer:

> **PIANGI (as Hannibal):**
> Sad to return to find the land we love, threatened once more by _Roma's_ far-reaching grasp...
>
> **REYER:** No, no, no! Signor, if you please: "Rome". We say "Rome" --- not "Roma"!
>
> _(Piangi argues with Reyer over the anglicization of "Rome" before grudgingly giving in.)_
>
> **PIANGI (as Hannibal):** Sad to return to find the land we love, threatened once more by _Rome's_ far-reaching grasp. Tomorrow we shall break the chains of _Rome_; tonight, rejoice: your army has come home.
>
> _(Rehearsal continues with a delightful ballet section.)_

Piangi's debate with Reyer provides an illustration of his obstinacy: He knows good and well what the script says, and nevertheless refuses to submit to the anglicized version of the Italian city's name. Even after being pressured into sticking to the script, he is clearly reluctant in doing so. 

| Differences | On screen | On stage |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| How Piangi's reluctance is exhibited | Piangi switches from ```/ˈro.ma/``` to ```/ɹəʊm/``` with a slightly patronizing undertone. | Piangi hardly conceals his patronization, comedically pronouncing "Rome" as ```/ɹəʊmːː/``` with a mockingly long ```/mːː/``` sound at the end. |
| How the rehearsal ends | Piangi is unable to unsheathe his sword from his scabbard, giving us the impression that this is indeed merely a rehearsal, with a couple of places that are yet to be perfected. | The live show really upped their schadenfreude game: Here, Piangi attempts but fails to mount an enormous prop elephant, which is a hilarious sight to behold. (Throughout the play, Piangi seems to be main source of comic relief, which I'll come back to later on.) |

After the rehearsal, Monsieur Lefevre, the owner of the Opera Populaire, announces his retirement and introduces the new managers Monsieur Firmin and Monsieur André. Firmin then requests whether Carlotta could perform for him an aria from Hannibal (titled "Think of Me") as a personal favor, to which Carlotta promptly accedes. One verse into the aria though, this happens:

> _(The scenic backdrop on stage falls from the flies unexpectedly, seemingly without explanation.)_
>
> **CHORUS GIRLS:** _(screaming)_ He's there, the Phantom of the Opera!
>
> _(...)_
>
> **LEFEVRE:** Buquet! Where is Buquet? Get that man down here. Buquet --- chief of the flies --- he's responsible for this. Buquet! For God's sake, man, what's going on up there?
>
> **BUQUET:** <br>
> Please monsieur don't look at me <br>
> As God's my witness I was not at my post <br>
> Please monsieur there's no one there <br>
> And if there is, well then it must be a ghost!
>
> **CHORUS GIRLS:** He's there, the Phantom of the Opera!

In an attempt to trivialize this apparent accident, Firmin comments that "these things do happen", but is rebutted by Carlotta, who is angered by the fact that the Opera House has long been jinxed by these inexplicable mishaps, and that no one has done anything to stop them. Both Carlotta and Piangi furiously storm offstage (with the latter amusingly calling the managers "amateurs"). 

In response to this, both the ballet mistress Madame Giry and her daughter/ballet girl Meg Giry propose that Christine Daaé, a chorus girl who also happens to be the daughter of a well-known violinist, replace Carlotta in Hannibal.

> **MEG:** Christine Daaé could sing it, sir.
>
> **ANDRE:** A ballet girl?
>
> **MEG:** Well, she's been taking lessons from a great teacher.
>
> **ANDRE:** Oh, from whom?
>
> **CHRISTINE:** I don't know, sir.
>
> _(...)_
>
> **FIRMIN:** Daaé? That's a curious name. Any relation to the violinist?
>
> **CHRISTINE:** My father, sir.
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** Let her sing for you, monsieur. She has been well-taught.

You would expect that this scene is the one where we are first introduced to the story's protagonist --- Christine Daaé. While this is true for the 2011 version, that's not exactly how that conversation went in the live performance, which brings me to my first criticism of the stage show. Remember the delightful ballet section from earlier? Apparently someone decided to insert an additional piece of dialogue _during_ the ballet rehearsal:

> **PIANGI (as Hannibal):** Tonight, rejoice: your army has come home. _(Ballet section begins.)_
>
> **LEFEVRE:** Signor Piangi, our principal tenor. He does play so opposite La Carlotta.
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** Gentlemen, please! If you would kindly move to one side?
>
> **LEFEVRE:** My apologies, Madame Giry. Madame Giry, our ballet mistress. I don't mind confessing, Monsieur Firmin, I shan't be sorry to be rid of the whole blessed business.
>
> **FIRMIN:** I keep asking you, monsieur, why exactly are you retiring?
>
> **LEFEVRE:** _(pauses, ignoring question)_ We take a particular pride here in the excellence of our ballets.
>
> **ANDRE:** _(pointing to Meg Giry)_ Who's that girl, Lefevre?
>
> **LEFEVRE:** Her? Meg Giry, Madame Giry's daughter. Promising dancer, Monsieur Andre, most promising.
>
> _(Ballet continues, with Christine messing up the choregraphy a few seconds later)_
>
> **MADAME GIRY:** You --- Christine Daaé! Concentrate, girl!
>
> **MEG:** _(whisperingly, to Christine)_ Christine, what's the matter?
>
> **FIRMIN:** _(to Lefevre)_ Daaé? Curious name.
>
> **LEFEVRE:** Swedish.
>
> **ANDRE:** Any relation to the violinist?
>
> **LEFEVRE:** His daughter, I believe. Always has her head in the clouds, I'm afraid. _(Ballet section ends.)_

The dialogue itself is fine, but I still find this decision fairly problematic for a few reasons:

- Having to pay attention to the conversation means that the audience cannot enjoy the gracefully synchronized movements from the dancers, which is unfortunate.
- It's hard to focus on spoken dialogue when there's orchestral music playing in the background.
- And finally the worst part: pacing. Bear in mind that the entire ballet section lasts for just over a minute. Try reading through the dialogue above (complete with pauses and clear enunciation) in 60 seconds, and you'll soon realize there's no plausible way whatsoever to deliver this part of the script at a natural speed, leaving the actors no choice but to rush through the dialogue at a frankly unorthodox pace.


### Think of Me / Angel of Music

Now, where was I? Oh right: Carlotta storms off and Madame Giry recommends Christine as a stand-in soprano. As a ballet girl, Christine isn't necessarily familiar with the lyrics and melody for Think of Me, which is why Monsieur Reyer, quite hysterically, offered her a very brief one-second glimpse at the sheet music, before promptly taking it away. This part wasn't featured in the 2011 proshot, so I absolutely did not see that gag coming --- it's hilarious.

In spite of her initial nervousness (which is portrayed incredibly in both productions), Christine manages to deliver a stunning rendition of Think of Me, be it during the rehearsal or in the live performance of Hannibal. Midway through the aria, we are also introduced to Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny, who as the Opera House's patron is watching Christine, her childhood friend, from an opera box. The song ends with a short, _a capella_ cadenza for which, while Kerhoas' singing is undeniably impressive, I personally prefer Boggess' performance in the 25th anniversary proshot due to the vibrancy of her voice.

Following her opera debut, Christine is reunited with her fellow dancers and is complimented by Madame Giry:

> **MADAME GIRY:** <br>
> _(to Christine)_ Yes, you did well. He will be pleased. <br>
> _(to dancers)_ And you! You were a disgrace! Such ronds de jambe! Such temps de cuisse! Come! We rehearse. Now.
>
> _(Madame Giry bangs her cane on the ground and is followed by the dancers, who rehearse on stage right. Christine wanders around as her dressing room becomes visible on stage left.)_ 
>
> **MYSTERIOUS VOICE:** Brava. Brava. Bravissima.
>
> **MEG:** Christine, Chrstine.
>
> **MYSTERIOUS VOICE:** _(lingeringly)_ Christine...

As Christine meanders backstage, she hears a mysterious voice praising her performance. I spotted a subtle dissimilarity in how this praise is expressed between the two productions:

| Differences | On screen | On stage |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| What the mysterious voice says | "Brava. Brava. Bravissima."<br> In Italian, "brava" is the feminine form of "bravo", meaning that the compliment is specifically directed at Christine. Personally, I prefer the use of "brava" instead of "bravi" because it fits better with the entire storyline, as we will see later. | "Bravi. Bravi. Bravissimi."<br> In Italian, "bravi" is the plural form of "bravo", so the compliment is directed to not just Christine, but the entire cast as well. To me, using "bravi" doesn't really make sense as it contradicts Madame Giry's previous comment that the dancers "were a disgrace". |

Afterwards, Christine is approached by Meg, who curiously asks how Christine is able to sing so well.

> **MEG:** I only wish I knew your secret; who is this new tutor?
>
> **CHRISTINE:**<br>
> Father once spoke of an angel<br>
> I used to dream he'd appear<br>
> Now as I sing I can sense him<br>
> And I know he's here<br>
> Here in this room he calls me softly<br>
> Somewhere inside hiding<br>
> Somehow I know he's always with me<br>
> he --- the unseen genius! _(...)_<br>
> Angel of Music --- guide and guardian --- grant to me your glory!
>
> **MEG:** Who is this angel, this...
>
> **BOTH:** Angel of Music, hide no longer, secret and strange angel!
>
> **CHRISTINE:** He's with me, even now. All around---
>
> **MEG:** Your hands are cold. Your face, Christine, it's white.
>
> **CHRISTINE:** It frightens me.
>
> **MEG:** Don't be frightened!

| Differences | On screen | On stage |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| The final lines of Angel of Music | Noticing how Christine suddenly turns pale as she fearfully discusses her Angel of Music, Meg points out that her face is turning "white". | This line is replaced with "Christine, are you alright?", which is reasonable given that in 2021, Lucy St. Louis became the first black performer to play the role of Christine.|

As Meg tries to help Christine calm down, she is sternly reminded by her mother Madame Giry that as a dancer, she must "go and practice" at once. Left alone, Christine returns to her dressing room, where she is visited by her old playfellow from long ago (along with someone else...?).


### Little Lotte / The Mirror

In the dressing room, Christine receives a visit from Raoul, who brings with him a single, red rose. Together, they recount their fond memories of the past, especially how they used to "read to each other dark stories of the North" as Christine's father played the violin. In particular, they recite the tale of Little Lotte:

> **CHRISTINE:**<br>
> "No what I love best, Lotte said,<br>
> is when I'm asleep in my bed,<br>
> and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head." _(...)_
>
> Father said, "When I'm in heaven, child, I will send the Angel of Music to you." Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I _have_ been visited by the Angel of Music.
>
> **RAOUL:** No doubt of it. And now we'll go to supper.
>
> **CHRISTINE:** No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict!
>
> **RAOUL:** I shan't keep you up late --- you must change; I must get my hat. Two minutes! Little Lotte.

Piecing together the last couple of scenes, we start to see Christine's and Raoul's different opinions on the Angel of Music. The story of Little Lotte clearly holds a special place in both of their hearts, but Christine seems particularly attached to this story especially after his father
