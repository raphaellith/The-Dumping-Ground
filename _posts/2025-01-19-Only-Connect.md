The puzzles in this post are inspired by (and have the same format as) the BBC quiz show Only Connect, or at least the first round thereof.

Below, you'll find six puzzles to solve. Each puzzle consists of four apparently random clues that share a hidden connection. Your goal is to work out the connection between these seemingly unrelated items. 

- In each puzzle, the first of four clues is automatically shown.
- Click on any of the currently displayed clues to reveal the next one.
- Once all four clues have been revealed, clicking again will display the answer.
- Generally speaking, the fewer clues you need to figure out the connection, the better.

For instance, a puzzle may have the clues

> 1. <span class="ff-din"> CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (dild.)</span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub></span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> Piper nigrum </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> NaCl </span>
> <div style="text-align: right">(from <i>Only Connect</i>, Series 1, Episode 9)</div>

which are linked by the fact that they are all **condiments** (vinegar, sugar, black pepper and table salt).

Another example might be

> 1. <span class="ff-din"> DALZIEL = 550 </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> SEEDY = 400 </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> EMCEE = 1100 </span>
> 1. <span class="ff-din"> IVY = 4 </span>
> <div style="text-align: right">(from <i>Only Connect</i>, Series 2, Episode 7)</div>

which have the connection that the words are all **Roman numeral homophones**. The words on the left, when read out, all sound like Roman numerals that correspond to the values shown on the right (DL, CD, MC and IV). Note that "Dalziel", a Scottish surname, is pronounced as "dee-EL".

Have fun with the ones below!

	<b>A couple of technical notes</b>

	<ul>
		<li> If you're reading this on your phone, tilt your device sideways for the best experience! </li>
		<li> I'm not entirely sure why, but it appears that Google Chrome simply refuses to perform the CSS styling and formatting for the puzzles properly. It works on most other browsers (Safari, Firefox, Opera, etc.) though! </li>
