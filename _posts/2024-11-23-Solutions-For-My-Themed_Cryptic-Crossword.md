The solutions to the cryptic crossword I posted last week can be downloaded [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-11-23/Themed-Cryptic-Crossword-Solutions.pdf){:target="_blank"}. My favourite clues are 2 Across, 3 Down and 17 Down.

The answer to the clue given in the description of this post is WORDPLAY (SWORDPLAY without its leading letter).
